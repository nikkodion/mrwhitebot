0,0,0,,One day, surely (close together) the first star in the sky (the first star) let's see it, we said
0,0,0,,For the two of us (this road) to split, it took (plenty) plenty enough time, didn't it
0,0,0,,A long, long time…
0,0,0,,Well, aren't you irritating (irritating) You're only concerned about yourself (myself)
0,0,0,,I can see through it all, you won't even meet my eyes (won't meet your eyes)
0,0,0,,You wouldn't get it (You, like that) What could I say to you (what would you say)
0,0,0,,Not a single thing, that's all
0,0,0,,Aah, on the windshield, the rain is flowing down—
0,0,0,,To be far away enough for my cheek to feel the touch of your breath, let me use that as an excuse, han…
0,0,0,,"I'm tired of it", with throwaway lines like that
0,0,0,,On the highway of cutting ties (Highway Night)
0,0,0,,A you that I don't know, that's what you've become (It might be so)
0,0,0,,So just KEEP AWAY, KEEP AWAY TONIGHT
0,0,0,,Solitude, Long time no see—I thought that was thanks to you
0,0,0,,But the one who was satisfied with dreaming the same dream was me
0,0,0,,It's good you came to see me, crossing this highway
0,0,0,,We're passing by each other at 100km/h
0,0,0,,Let me say it, for the first and last time
0,0,0,,On this selfish highway (Highway Night)
0,0,0,,For any longer than this, waiting is something I don't plan to do (How mean)

0,0,0,,You can't be here as a fan, miss
0,0,0,,Even a cat must face rising hurdles when walking
0,0,0,,As a performer, you must do your best, miss
0,0,0,,Second, second, second place isn't what you want, is it?

0,0,0,,I'd like you to tell me the reason behind them
0,0,0,,We can share the burden because we are rivals
0,0,0,,Come on now, let's pull those fangs out, tiger cub running amok to escape
0,0,0,,If I let many stars become my guides, I will drift to the stage
0,0,0,,Starting here, I still, can't stop walking yet
0,0,0,,I shall never, ever give up on my journey
0,0,0,,A hazy landscape, a perishing dream, go subsist on nothing but the haze of your pipe dream
0,0,0,,All you do is parrot borrowed lines; your star is just a piece of space trash
0,0,0,,Starting now, you've still, gotta try and kill me, right!! Don't you!!
0,0,0,,I didn't look upwards so many times just for show
0,0,0,,I will step over the limits and zero
0,0,0,,What have you been looking at all this time?
0,0,0,,This is my unbreakable pen, sometimes stronger than a sword, than even a katana
0,0,0,,Let the curtain fall, we'll meet each other on stage in due time
0,0,0,,O Stage Person, did you summon me?
0,0,0,,Why would one such as I summon a devil?
0,0,0,,That soul filled with obsession
0,0,0,,Shall illuminate the very bottom of hell
0,0,0,,That soul!
0,0,0,,The greatest brilliance
0,0,0,,Eternal boredom

0,0,0,,For heroes, there are trials
0,0,0,,For saints, there are temptations
0,0,0,,For you, a devil
0,0,0,,For me, a devil
0,0,0,,Thence reflect, O water's surface, my infinite self
0,0,0,,Right now, the stage belongs to me
0,0,0,,With a grin of deception I'll tear this piece of cloth
0,0,0,,I want to show you my feelings becoming dyed in black
0,0,0,,Only me, always, forever
0,0,0,,You only need to look at me
0,0,0,,If I'm on the stage, if I'm in front of you, ugly and beautiful, I will expose anything and everything, all of me, all of me
0,0,0,,Forever and ever, I'd like to cross swords with you
0,0,0,,For each of us two, a rival
0,0,0,,Aah, you are…!
0,0,0,,Please, Karen—wake up
0,0,0,,Remember the promise the two of us made
0,0,0,,I believe that saying goodbye here isn't our fate
0,0,0,,If you desire, gather a star
0,0,0,,If you desire, become a star
0,0,0,,If you desire, gather a star
0,0,0,,If you desire, become a star
0,0,0,,You are me, I am you
0,0,0,,The past is the future, the future is now
0,0,0,,Burn, burn, burn it all up
0,0,0,,Onward to the next stage
0,0,0,,Our, our Starlight, if we were to retrace it
0,0,0,,I would be reborn as myself
0,0,0,,Something lies within my pounding heart (Lead the way)
0,0,0,,And I reach out to the stars (Over and over)
0,0,0,,Round and round on the stage (I will not give up)
0,0,0,,We become stronger (I awoke)
0,0,0,,I wanted to see you all this time (Star to star)
0,0,0,,Even if I'm battered by the headwind (I believe)
0,0,0,,Then, to our promised place (Connect)
0,0,0,,Starlight, Starlight
0,0,0,,Starlight, Starlight
0,0,0,,The longed for star, at the top of the tower
0,0,0,,It's Hikari that burns your eyes
0,0,0,,It's beautiful, it's dazzling, it's painful, it's frustrating
0,0,0,,To take, to be taken from, it's heartrending
0,0,0,,Being captivated, growing closer, being attracted, parting
0,0,0,,In you, I end up losing myself
0,0,0,,Just how many times can the stars burst?
0,0,0,,Welcome, myself; to Position Zero
0,0,0,,Someday, someday, may we reach it; the sky
